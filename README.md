# 🛒 eCommerce Store Analysis Using Excel

## 📌 Overview  
This project explores a comprehensive eCommerce dataset featuring customer orders from major Indian platforms such as **Flipkart, Myntra, Meesho, Amazon, and Nalli**. Leveraging Excel’s data handling capabilities, I performed structured analysis and visual storytelling to uncover business trends, customer behavior, and sales performance.

## 📂 Dataset  
The Excel-based dataset includes:
- Order ID, Product Category, Size, Quantity, and Price  
- Customer demographics: Gender and Age Group  
- Sales Channel (B2C), Platform, and Order Status  
- Location information: City, State, Postal Code  
- Dates of order and month of transaction

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Track category-level demand across gender and age groups  
- Compare sales performance across eCommerce platforms  
- Identify geographic sales patterns across Indian states  
- Present clean and interactive visual summaries using Excel dashboards, slicers, and pivot charts

## ⚙️ Tools & Techniques  
- **Microsoft Excel**  
  - Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts for summarized insights  
  - Conditional Formatting to highlight trends and outliers  
  - Excel Filters and Slicers for interactive analysis  
  - Lookup formulas (e.g., VLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH) for data cleaning  
  - Date functions for month-wise breakdowns  
  - Bar charts, stacked visuals, and geo heatmaps to support storytelling

## 📈 Key Insights  
- Flipkart and Myntra led adult clothing sales, with kurta sets and western wear dominating  
- Women customers preferred Meesho and Myntra for ethnic and budget-friendly fashion  
- Southern states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu showed high purchase volumes  
- Most orders were successfully delivered, indicating reliable logistics

## 🔧 Challenges Solved  
- Cleaned and standardized category and size labels for consistent analysis  
- Resolved missing values and removed duplicates for better pivot performance  
- Designed user-friendly dashboards with filtering capabilities  
- Created automated monthly summaries using formulas and charting

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  
- Incorporate Excel macros for automated reporting  
- Add dynamic dashboards with drop-downs for date, platform, and region filtering  
- Compare customer retention and repeat orders using unique customer identifiers (if available)

## 🙌 Acknowledgements
